  "Everybody lies.",
  "The life itself. Sex.",
  "Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, 'You can't always get what you want.'",
  "Read less, more TV.",
  "It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.",
  "I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.",
  "Hypothetical — if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline? Don't answer yet. Saying no will cause both of us pain. Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.",
  "You sexually molested your son. Your walk, tabes dorsalis. You have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our patient, presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.",
  "Hey! Stop that Jew!",
  "Life is pain! I wake up every morning, I'm in pain. I go to work in pain. You know how many times I wanted to just give up? How many times I thought about ending it?",
  "Attention! I have an announcement. As you go about your day, I would like you to be aware of the fact that I slept with Lisa Cuddy.",

  "Cancer doesn't make you special. Molestation on the other hand...",
  "Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that.",
  "Had a happy go to hell",
  "I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano.",
  "Do you have hair in your special place?",
  "You know why you're black?",
  "You have to have sex with Cuddy.",
  "Can you score me some Vicodin?",
  "My leg hurts.",
  "God, I wish you weren't a pedophile.",
  "Less creepy, more gay.",
  "You talk a lot of smack about tranny hookers.",
  "A woman in Florida said, 'look, Jesus is on my cheese sandwich.'",
  "It's never lupus",
  "I think my penis stopped breathing; do you know CPR?",
