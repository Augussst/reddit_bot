  "Everybody lies.",
  "The life itself. Sex.",
  "Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, 'You can't always get what you want.'",
  "Sure. The ex-boy-toy. Eh, that makes sense.",
  "Read less, more TV.",
  "It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.",
  "I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.",
  "You're black man",
  "Hypothetical — if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline? Don't answer yet. Saying no will cause both of us pain. Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.",
  "You sexually molested your son. Your walk, tabes dorsalis. You have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our patient, presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.",
  "Hey! Stop that Jew!",
  "Life is pain! I wake up every morning, I'm in pain. I go to work in pain. You know how many times I wanted to just give up? How many times I thought about ending it?",
  "Attention! I have an announcement. As you go about your day, I would like you to be aware of the fact that I slept with Lisa Cuddy.",
  "You’re being an idiot.",
  "Interesting. It means there’s either a neurological component or he’s having an affair.",
  "Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient’s dead. You killed him",
  "It’s a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.",
  "I think we may have an anal hygiene violation there.",
  "Gruesome and low tech. Kiss me I love it.",
  "You’re comparing me to a n*zi? Nice.",
  "I'm gay. Oh, that's not what you meant. It does explain a lot though. No girlfriend, always with Wilson, obsession with sneakers...",
  "Cancer doesn't make you special. Molestation on the other hand...",
  "Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that.",
  "Had a happy go to hell",
  "I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano.",
  "Do you have hair in your special place?"
